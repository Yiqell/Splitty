    Git assignment is due on friday. If anyone fails, there would be a repair option.
    We have to start coding this week because the knock-out criteria starts applying(100+ lines of code, 3+ commits, 
    1+ merge requests, 1+ merge request approval and add a constructive message of 100+ lines on at least one merge request). We need to have those for every week from now on, except for the midterms week. If we fail to meet all the requirements on a week, we have to make up for the workload on the next week. We will receive feedback on the meeting to improve for next meetings. 
- Presentation of the current app to TA (0 min)
- Talking Points: (Inform/ brainstorm/ decision making/ discuss)
- GIT assignment progress (10 min) 
    Everyone is on track with that, 3/6 finished it and the rest are still doing it, but there are no issues.
- roadmap for the coding part (3 min)
    Everyone should have the template project set up by tomorrow. We will meet tomorrow at 14 to divide the tasks. Everyone should have a look at the main assignment(basic requirements especially) to be able to efficiently distribute the parts of code. Everyone should have a look at the lecture from yesterday to have a better understanding of the principles that we can use in the code of conduct. 
- making the code of conduct(30 min)
    We made a draft for the code of conduct which we will finalize at a separate meeting tomorrow.
- Summarize action points: Who , what , when? (? min)
    There will be another meeting tomorrow with all of us at 14, since we didn't manage to divide the tasks for the coding part or to finish the code of coduct.
- Feedback round: What went well and what can be improved next time? (2 min)
- Planned meeting duration != actual duration? Where/why did you mis -estimate? (1 min)
    The total time was more than 45 min, so the time schedule was a bit off.
- Question round: Does anyone have anything to add before the meeting closes? (5 min)
- Closure (1 min)
