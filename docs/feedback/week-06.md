# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

*TA Instructions:*
Were there a chair and a minute taker? Every students needs to hold each role at least once in the course.

Mark: **Pass**

Feedback: You had both a chair and a minute taker


#### Agenda 

Mark: **Excellent**

Feedback: At this point you guys know what works for you, so keep it up.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback: I like the inclusion of the action goals, overall there isn't much that I can complain about


#### Chair performance

Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback: I will largely blame the discrepancies from the time stamps due to the discussions on the feedback received. I liked that you incorporated them into the agenda as they were released after you made the agenda.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: **Excellent**

Feedback: Most of you at this point have no issue talking to each other and I like how you work together.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback: I really like the amount of progress you had. Although you still have a few weeks, I would keep an eye on the time to make sure that the bigger bugs currently in the application are fixed before you put your head to implementing extra features.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback: Not much to complain about here either, the action goals you write down after the meeting seem pretty even and everyone is getting their fair share of work to do. Maybe there are some discrapancies between a few members where I get the feeling someone is working more than other people, but hopefully this evens out when the overall work done by individuals is analyzed.
