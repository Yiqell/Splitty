# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: **Pass**

Feedback: You had both a chair and a minute taker


#### Agenda 

Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback: At this point I feel like you guys are establishing a way that you want to meetings to happen. There is still a little improvement to make on the estimations but at this point your focus is on the correct things to discuss.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback: The amount of notes is basically on point with what I expect. Do make sure to include the action goals for each individual next week!


#### Chair performance

Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback: All in all the chairs' performance has been improving significantly. There is still some improvement to be done on making sure that the agenda is followed properly and that the chair remains in charge for the whole duration of the meeting. But I do feel like the team is grasping what the role of the Chair should be!


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback: In general you guys are taking ownership of the meeting and have a nice working environment. Maybe my feedback for last week was misinterpreted as I still want you guys to encourage the people that talk less to speak up, I just want it to happen in a positive encouraging way. Either way your meetings have significantly improved!


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback: In general you guys are doing good progress. I am hoping to see the same if not more progress next time we see each other. If your progress does not decrease you are definitely on time to have a working application.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback: I think everyone is contributing equally. There is little that I can add as feedback apart from reminding you to go over the assigned tasks and completed tasks of the prior week in an orderly fashion. In general not much to complain.
