# Get to know each other

## Formative Assessment

#### 1) Self-organization - **Insufficient**

It's very important that each one of you contributes to the conversation and actively participates. You as a team are responsible to involve each other in the meetings and ask for each other's ideas. Obviously you are just getting to know each other, and I am expecting you to only get better with time. Other than this (unfortunately important) point, you eventually took charge of the meeting and managed to get some stuff done!

#### 2) Suggested Topics - **Good**

Since you didn't have anything too specific to do this week, I would say that you covered all the most important topics pretty well. This will also get much better in the coming weeks with the addition of a Chair that will coordinate the meetings.
