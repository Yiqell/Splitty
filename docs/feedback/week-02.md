# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: **Pass**

Feedback: You had both a chair and a minute taker.


#### Agenda 

Mark: **Good**

Feedback: The agenda was added in time and it followed the template, some minor mistakes with the date but that's irrelevant. Overall you planned to cover all necessary topics and you added some great talking points. However, the time estimation was quite off especially since the total meeting time estimate was much more than 45 minutes.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: **Does not apply**


#### Chair performance

Mark: **Sufficient**

Feedback: For being the first chair you did quite ok, I liked that you tried involving everyone, asking each person about their progress with the git assignment for example! However, for the future chairs, it's important that you come as prepared as you can for the meeting. You were a bit unlucky due to being stuck on the git assignment, nevertheless I would like to see that in the future the chair drives the meeting forward, and makes sure that the whole agenda is finished in time according to the estimates given. For the chair the agenda is almost like a cheat sheet for talking points so they should always know what other topics to bring up as they wrote them down earlier. Also, do keep the time in mind, as it is important to properly end a meeting with a feedback round and leave time for any further additions from the rest of the team.
Overall, there are some points to improve on but great job to step up to lead the first meeting without any reference on how to do it! 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: **Sufficient**

Feedback: Some of you quite actively participate and whenever there are quiet moments I noticed some team members managed to step in and give ideas on how to push the conversation forward, if you feel like you belong in this category you are doing great! However there are still a few members that simply contribute too little or not at all. The chair is responsable for making sure that everyones has the chance to give their opinion, if someone is too passive encourage them directly to contribute to the conversation. However, any of you could also help with this as this is a very important aspect of the meeting.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: **Good**

Feedback: This week there it was still not a problem to not have something to show me, so this section will be more about how you tackled the technical part of getting started with the project. I liked that the template project was discussed, you also talked about how the database will work and some of you already played around with it a bit. I would've hoped more of you had the template project already running as the lab for this was around a week ago, but you still have time to catch up until next week. Please keep in mind that next week I will be looking for much more things around this rubric item, and I will also expect to see some code :)


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: **Good**

Feedback: Since there were no goals set last week, I will dedicate this section only to your task distribution and planning for this week. You talked quite a bit about how to divide up and write the Code of Conduct as well as how to divide up the coding tasks. You also planned a meeting this week to further work on this which is great! I do feel there is still some insecurity around what you actually have to do, but I trust this will change over the course of this week. Here as well, please keep in mind that next week I will also be assessing whether the goals you set during this meeting are discussed/completed/in progress and if everyone seems to be contributing equally.
