#### Agenda 

Mark: **Excellent**

Feedback: You had a great agenda.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: **Excellent**

Feedback: Great amount of notes. Debatable whether it is necessary to know that the next chairs have been choosen through "bets".


#### Chair performance

Mark: **Excellent**

Feedback: I won't blame the performace because of the discord call, I think you did a great job at keeping the meeting together and going through your agenda.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback: Given that two of you were calling from discord, I think you contributed and participated still quite enough despite the difficulties.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: **Very Good**

Feedback: I think you have a great product, now that I looked at it in depth I noticed more mistakes but also more working features. Sorry about the "adding expenses" issue, I have checked and I can indeed add expenses after dropping the db! However I was still unable to edit them (on last Tuesday), therefore you are still missing some of the basic requirements unfortunately.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: **Excellent**

Feedback: I am seeing improvements in the disstirbution over the weeks, keep it up.
