# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: **Pass**

Feedback: You had both a chair and a minute taker.


#### Agenda 

Mark: **Good**

Feedback: Agenda was added to the repository on time and it followed the template. In general the points were quite clear with a few exceptions. For example, the section "next steps that need to be taken" is a bit vague as to what it refers to (if it's code related, what part of the codebase do you think should be talked about, etc.). Make sure that if you were a simple participant you would be able to prepare for what is going to be talked about just by looking at the agenda, instead of just showing up to see what will be discussed. Also it would really help if you could name the agendas based on the week you are in. This was week 3, not meeting2 (technically you even had 3 meetings so I just don't understand what's going on with the numbering sorry).


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: **Good**

Feedback: Notes are merged in the agenda. Please in the future make sure to make the notes a subsection of the agenda points, it would make it much more readable. For now you mainly wrote down goals for the whole team. Please in the future try stating concrete but realistic goals for everyone, so that they can then be discussed in the meeting next week. Even if these tasks are assigned in a later meeting, please do write them down as they are very important for me.



#### Chair performance


Mark: **Insufficient**

Feedback: Although you started off well and you seemed prepared for the meeting, at some point you just seemed to not talk anymore and let others lead the meeting. If someone would've walked past the table starting from a little before the midpoint of the meeting they would've thought Mireia was the Chair. I know this may sound harsh but I want to make sure that this point gets through to all of you as it is very important. The chair should be leading the meeting from start to finish. Also the chair should be the one to move the meeting along, I heard a couple times someone say "maybe we should talk about this now". This should not have to happen if the chair keeps the meeting on route.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: **Good**

Feedback: The improvement from the first few meetings is very noticable. I do feel like you guys are starting to get along well. I hope the issue with some people not speaking up will improve as I seem to see that it already started to do so (although it is still present and it is the main think keeping you from the `excellent`). It's great that you guys are encouraging each other to speak, I would love to see more of that. Do make sure to not laugh about the more shy people in the group instead involve them in the conversation.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: **Good**

Feedback: Their is clear progress from last week and it seems like you are on pace for the project if you get the tasks that you planned for this week done. Make sure to not postpone some important tasks in the backend too much such as understanding the given database.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: **Good**

Feedback: Unfortunately there was no action list for each person last week, I hope you can adjust to this in the next few meetings and write down a/few bullet points for each person for example. This helps me also have a better view on what (as well as the amount) everyone is working on. If you think you are struggling with some task or with understanding a concept, please reach out for help from your team mates! In general it seems that everyone is doing their fair share from what I hear being assigned in the meeting.
