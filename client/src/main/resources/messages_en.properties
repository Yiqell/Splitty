# This is the language template file for the English language.
# It contains all the text elements that are used in the application.
# The text elements are defined as key-value pairs, where the key is the name of the element
# and the value is the text that is displayed in the application.
# To translate the application to a different language, create a new file with the same structure
# and replace the text values with the translated text.
# The file should be named according to the language code of the language you are translating to.
# For example, if you are translating to German, the file should be named messages_de.properties.
# The language code is a two-letter code that is used to identify the language.

# A list of language codes can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes

# When done translating, please submit the file to the email address provided in the README file
# so that it can be included in the application.
